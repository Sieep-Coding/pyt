# `spark` - *S*ystem for *P*rogressive and *A*ctive *R*elationship *K*eeping ✨

`spark` is a **GUI** to manage essential **business data.** It is a **lightweight, fast, local-only** application designed for my personal use-case but applicable to small businesses or individuals who need an efficient tool for **organizing contacts, tracking leads, exporting data to excel, viewing table relationships, running reports, and managing tasks/projects** without relying on [costly](https://instances.vantage.sh/) cloud services or heavy enterprise solutions. Built with a **reliable but fast stack:** `python`, `tkinter`, and `SQLite`. To improve the development experience, I have developed a boring `makefile` to manage build scripts and some spicy [hot reloading](hot_reload.py) with [watchdog.](https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/) Tested on `Linux Ubuntu`, `WSL`, and `Linux Mint`.

## Core Features 💪
I want this to run as fast as possible, with the goal of keeping the executable under a few hundred MB.

Some other features include:
- **Adding, managing, removing data** through forms. 📃
- **No server!** 🙀 
  - Relies on a single `.db` file locally. 🍻
- **Exporting** to common file-types. 💾
- **Viewing data, reports, table relationships** easily. 📊
- **Simple, *Fast AF***, `SQLite` backend. 🏃‍➡️
- [Hot reloading](hot_reload.py) with [watchdog](https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/) for insane productivity. ⏰

> #### But why? 🤔
> "In the same way a **woodworker** invests the time in a jig, a **programmer** can build a code generator. 
> Once built, it can be used throughout the life of the project **at virtually no cost.**"
