# pyt

A python UI to manage essential business data with tkinter and a *FAST* sqlite backend.

## Core Features

I want this to run as fast as possible, with the goal of keeping the executable under a few hundred MB.

Some other features include:

- Adding, managing, removing data through forms
- Exporting to common filetypes
- Viewing data and reports easily
- *Fast* SQLite backend
